										<h2>Major Red Flag </h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										<strong>Coco is a dog so he probably can't see red. Hence, he can't see his own red flag. </strong> </br>
										</br> êÇØ He has big huge attitude problem. He will stare at you, bark at you, growl at you, walk away from you.
										</br> êÇØ He asks for food under the table a lot. His tatic is simple yet effective, his eyes.
										</br> êÇØ When it's raining outside, he won't go out to pee/ poop unless he REALLY needs to. 
										</br> êÇØ After you brush his teeth, wash his paws, take a shower for him, 
										he would give you an attitude/ timeout for 5 minutes (depends on his mood)

												<h3>Be Patient</h3>
											</header>
											<p> Even though he has many red flags, trust me, be patient with him. 
												I wasn't patient with him because I see his potential. I don't do potential as 
												an investor. He is a good dog, it takes time for him. He might growl at you, 
												distance himself from you. However, if you just let him have it. He will come back
												and he will let you pet him, let you love him. He will be the sweetest dog you can find.

												feelings, just be calm and nice to him. He will open up to you sooner or later.
